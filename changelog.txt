Cleanup

0.9.1 - 2023-01-04T07:01:56Z
Now uses MonoMod ( https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod )
As a result of moving to MonoMod, several features (including new speedrun splits, and clock-tower-ignore-time) got cut.
Also removed the janky randomizer.
Note the effects that utilize `NesGlitches` have been disabled because the class `NesGlitches` is flagged as an internal class, which apparently causes errors and I have yet to figure out how to fix this issue. 
Older versions have been archived.
