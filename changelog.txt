Cleanup

0.9.1
Now uses MonoMod ( https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod )
As a result of moving to MonoMod, several features (including new speedrun splits, and clock-tower-ignore-time) got cut.
Also removed the janky randomizer.
Note the effects that utilize `NesGlitches` have been disabled because the class `NesGlitches` is flagged as an internal class, which apparently causes errors and I have yet to figure out how to fix this issue. 
Older versions have been archived.

0.9.2
Added support for custom level packs.
Bug fixes
Fixed glitch effects
Re-added janky randomizer

0.9.3
New inverted gravity effect
Bug fixes
Miscellaneous improvements
HAT Compatible

0.9.4
re-removed janky randomizer; use https://github.com/admoore0/fez-randomizer if you want a randomizer
